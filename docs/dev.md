# Lucent Tech Blog

## Purpose

A digital space to write about any tech question's I've asked myself throughout
my programming journey. The intent is to answer these questions in the unique
way that I understand the problem/solution. Ideally, I'd like to provide a tool
for other developers who are interested in learning about how to select and use
technologies with best practices and conventions in mind. As of writing this,
I have my bachelors in applied science in computer engineering from Queen's
University. Although I have significant technical knowledge under my belt, I
am constantly learning about the world of computers. Anything written in this
blog represents my current understanding of the content and it always subject
to improvement.

## Core Values

- Consice language to minimize reading time and maximize understanding
- Current best practices evident in examples provided
- Reason behind all decicions made is explicit (either in current blog page
  or elsewhere in the website)
- Future proofing content where feasible by explaining the process in which the
  information was derived
